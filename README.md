### My Tribute Page

Originally coming from a music background, I chose to dedicate my tribute page for this project to one of my all-time favourite singers/songwriters, Joni Mitchell. I have created an attractive looking, fully responsive homepage which contains a timeline of Joni's life and achievements as well as a discography section with links to the Spotify pages for each of her albums.

I have used only HTML and CSS to create this page as per the instructions on FreeCodeCamp.
